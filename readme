PHP Automatic Thumbnailer.
Written by Chris Hamilton (http://github.com/arcynum/Thumbnailer).

This is a function which will automatically generate thumbnails for your webpages on the fly.
Instead of having to manually create thumbnails for images on your website, this function will generate them for you, at any size you specify.

To use this, simply include or require the PHP file in your workflow.

include('thumbnailer.php'); (Code will continue if there is a problem)
require('thumbnailer.php'); (Code will break if it cannot be included)

Then you simply call the function in code.
getThumbnail("relative/folder/where/image/is/located", "image_name_in_folder.jpg, width, height);

So an actual call might be
getThumbnail("images/banner/", "header_banner.jpg", 150, 150);

This will generate a thumbnail in a subfolder called thumbs within the "images/banner/" folder. If the directory doesn't exist, it will be created.
The thumbnail in the folder will be named like this

widthxheight_originalname.jpg
as above
150x150_header_banner.jpg

So the final file will be located as
"images/banner/thumbs/150x150_header_banner.jpg"


REMEMBER:
The steps above will generate a thumbnail, but if you want to write it into the HTML itself, you need to print the return value.
ie. print(getThumbnail("images/banner/", "header_banner.jpg", 150, 150));

An image embed in HTML would be something like this.
<img src="<?php print(getThumbnail("images/banner/", "header_banner.jpg", 150, 150)); ?>" title="The Headers Banner" />
